# Henka

Henka is a way to move data from one place to another, like a worse version of [Broadway](https://github.com/dashbitco/broadway).

## Installation

by adding `henka` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
